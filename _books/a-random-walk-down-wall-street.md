Today, it's fairly well accepted that the best way for most individuals to build wealth is to regularly invest in a diverse set of low-cost index funds over long time periods using tax advantaged retirement accounts. But there was a time when those ideas were fairly heretical. This book, originally published in 1973 (before Vanguard created the first Index Fund), was one of the first to make a comprehensive case for passive, diversified, long-term investing, in a world full of stock brokers and analysts attempting to beat the market. The author uses academic ideas like the [Random Walk Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk_hypothesis) and the [Efficient-Market Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis) to support his case, and provides case-studies and counter-arguments for seemingly every alternative investing approach. The book was exhaustive and clearly written for someone who needed convincing (in other words: not me). So while the writing was entertaining and updated for modern times (I read the 12th edition), I still struggled to work through the 12+ hour audiobook.

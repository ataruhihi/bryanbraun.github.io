This is a short story about a faithful Mormon man who dies and finds himself condemned to Zoroastrian hell (it turns out that Zoroastrianism was the one true religionâ€”who knew). But instead of burning in fire and brimstone for eternity, he is sent to a library containing every possible book and told that he can only leave when he finds the one that contains his life story. It was a fascinating premise. The story grapples with infinity in both time and space, raising questions about about life, hope, and purpose, and then leaving you alone to wrestle with the implications. I've never quite read anything like it.

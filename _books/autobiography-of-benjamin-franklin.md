Benjamin Franklin is one of those quintessential American figures, so it seems like there would be dozens of biographies of him out there. The truth is, there really aren't that many... probably because he wrote his own (and who has the audacity to try to out-write Ben Franklin, on the topic of himself?). Ben's autobiography was published over 200 years ago, so I was worried that it would be difficult to understand. It really wasn't that bad. Ben was ambitious, but it took several tries before he achieved financial success. Once he did, however, he spent the rest of his life pursuing a mix of productive hobbies and public service (which, I admit, made me feel a bit jealous). The book meanders a bit in his later years, but many of these details helped paint a picture of his world (like negotiating with Quakers or arguing in favor of the smallpox vaccine). Overall, the book gave me a sense that Ben Franklin was just a regular person who worked hard, got lucky a few times, served in his community, and somehow ended up on the $100 dollar bill.

The book follows the fictional story of a man training to become a Samurai archer, and the lessons he must learn in order to become great at his craft. As he faces various obstacles, his Sensei, Akira, gives him the advice he needs to overcome and achieve his goals. The story is fiction, but its purpose is to teach the reader about the mindsets that lead to success. The biggest lesson was the importance of loving the process and letting the results emerge as a byproduct. I also enjoyed the points around visualization, patience, and rest (the stuff I probably need to work on the most, myself). Overall, it was very stoic, and an excellent reminder of some timeless ideas.

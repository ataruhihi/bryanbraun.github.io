This is a biography of Mormonism's founder, Joseph Smith, as written by Richard Bushman a professor of history at Columbia University. I became interested in the book because of [its reputation](https://www.amazon.com/Joseph-Smith-Rough-Stone-Rolling/dp/1400077532#customerReviews) for being exceptionally honest and unbiased in its treatment of a controversial figure. While reading, several things stuck out to me. Between the poverty of his childhood, the health challenges that afflicted his family, and the persecutions of his critics, Joseph's short life was a struggle. Yet despite it all, he remained singularly focused on building a society of people who sought a closer connection to God (it turns out that 1840's frontier America was an exceptionally difficult time and place to do it). Joseph's remarkable claims were polarizing and his personal flaws left many disillusioned. But his singular vision drew thousands to his cause, and created a legacy that continues beyond his death and into modern times.

I was expecting this to be a book about the mental patterns associated with poverty (scarcity mindset, etc), but I was wrong. It was more like a collection of principles, tactics, and mindsets to adopt if you want to get rich. The author is super direct about this goal. You're trying to get rich. Period. Not "become famous" or "achieve a comfortable lifestyle." I was pretty skeptical because this felt like huckster territory, but as the book progressed, I found myself nodding my head to a lot of the concepts. For example: "your wealth should always be used to generate more wealth," and "don't scale your standard of living with income." I ended up feeling pretty confident that if someone followed all his advice, then yeah, they'd probably end up rich (but of course, it's not always easy advice to follow). I feel like this is a great book if you want to understand the game. Then, once you understand it, you can decide how committed you are to playing it.

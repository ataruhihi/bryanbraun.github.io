This book is an autobiographical memoir of Phil Knight, focusing on the history of Nike, his footware and athletics company. It begins with just an idea from a college student and follows his burgeoning shoe startup as it fights for survival all the way to its IPO in 1980. The quirky story grabbed my attention. The team was so eccentric, so obsessive. Over and over, the company could have been wiped off the earth, but every time they narrowly escaped disaster. It's funny... they never had trouble selling their shoes. It just goes to show that the world is chaotic and business is hard, even when your product is in demand.

I picked up this book because Ryan Holiday wrote it, and I really liked his other books. In this one, he writes about the importance of seeking out stillness in our lives. All too often, people are willing to sacrifice inner-peace in their pursuit to perform at the top of their field. Ryan's message is that _you don't have to_. It's a false dichotomy. Throughout the book he shares stories about Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Michael Phelps, and others who paid a heavy price because they neglected the need for stillness. He makes a good case for the importance of sleep, routines, solitude, and balanceâ€”pursuits that we trivialize at the cost of our own peace and fulfillment. Overall it was an important book and one that I'm glad I made the time to read.

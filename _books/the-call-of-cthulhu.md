This book is horror-fiction, which is a genre I've never really read, but I wanted to try it out after reading [H. P. Lovecraft's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft). I picked this book specifically because it's the origin of a creature called Cthulhu, which keeps reappearing in other works. First off, I want to say that I loved the *idea* of this book. [The first paragraph](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7736263-the-most-merciful-thing-in-the-world-i-think-is) seriously gave me chills. As the story progressed, I was kind of disappointed to see it turn more into a more typical monster story (though Cthulhu is way more interesting than Godzilla or The Blob or whatever). I really wanted more of that "mental horror as a consequence of actually seeing reality for what it is" stuff. There were moments of that, but ultimately it left me wanting more.

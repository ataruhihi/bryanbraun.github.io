This book describes the history of Bell Labs and the people who worked there. I picked up the book as a recommendation, and I didn't really know the historical significance of the labs, which set me up for some surprises. Bell Labs played a huge role in the advancement of information technology in the 1900s. The labs started at a time when invention was largely trial and error (think, "Edison's 1000 attempts to build a light bulb"). By hiring scientists to do fundamental research, they made a ton of discoveries and then applied them towards their business of building out a world-wide communications network. The labs produced 9 Nobel Prizes, and dozens of inventions (like the transistor, laser, fiber-optics, cell towers, and Unix), before
the break-up of the Western Electric monopoly led to the labs decline. The book didn't provide much as far as personal takeaways go, but it was a nice read about an interesting topic.

This book walks through some common career advancement paths for people in the tech industry (based on the author's experience climbing the management career ladder while working at Rent the Runway). I read it because I wanted to get some perspective on these kinds of roles and I heard that the book was a good read both for managers and non-managers alike. Overall, it did a great job of describing each of the roles and brought several unexpected insights along the way.

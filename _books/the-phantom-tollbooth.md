I first read this book about twenty years ago and wanted to read it again to my kids. I remembered it being good, but re-reading it as an adult blew me away. It has a fun story, an original setting, and clever characters, but where it really shines is the wordplay. The author creates an entire world out of double-meanings, personifications, and literary devices, which is equal parts awe-inspiring and laugh-out-loud funny. Every scene twists your perspective, from the boy who grows downward (from his final, eventual, height), to the island of Conclusions (you get there by jumping). It's as if Alice fell down the rabbit hole, only to land in a Shel Silverstien world. I had a lot of fun remembering the scenes I had forgotten and catching all the clever references I missed the first time around. I especially loved the poignant bits of wisdom carefully placed among the puns. What an incredible book.

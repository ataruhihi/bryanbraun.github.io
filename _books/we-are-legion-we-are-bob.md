My friend recommended this book to me during a conversation about science-fiction. It didn't disappoint. The story follows a guy named Bob, who earns a bunch of money, signs up for a service to have his head cryogenically frozen upon death, and then promptly gets hit by a truck. When he awakes in the future, he has to learn how to navigate a new world full of geo-political changes, technological advancements, and opportunities to explore the galaxy. The story was witty, and the audiobook narrator did a great job handling all the characters and portraying their sense of humor. I may have to check out the sequels.

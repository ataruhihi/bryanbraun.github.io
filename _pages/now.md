I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. It's getting colder every day. ðŸŒ¬

## At Work

I'm working at [Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com/), building web applications mostly in JavaScript. I've also been doing a lot of much needed open-source work, cleaning up our public repos.

I'm working out of my home office, which is nice. I've had to replace my biking routine with pushups, but I enjoy eating lunch with my wife and kids.

Whenever I get a spare evening, I usually spend it working on [musicboxfun.com](https://musicboxfun.com).

## At Home

I'm spending a lot of time at home these days (due to COVID) and it suits me. I'm more involved with the kids learning and it's fun coming up with [lunch lessons](https://www.instagram.com/lunchlesson/) and seeing [daily demos](/2019/07/16/daily-demos-a-ritual-for-raising-kids-that-create/). Saturdays I do a lot of reluctant home maintenance. Sundays I spend all day with my family.

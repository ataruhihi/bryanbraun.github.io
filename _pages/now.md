I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. It's summer. ☀️

## At Work

I'm working at [Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com/), building web applications. I do a little bit of everything but I'm currently spending most of my time writing [Go](https://golang.org/) and building a serverless backend with GraphQL, Lambdas, and other AWS infrastructure.

I'm working out of my home office, which is nice. I've had to replace my biking routine with pushup, but I enjoy eating lunch with my wife and kids.

Whenever I get a spare evening, I usually spent it working on [musicboxfun.com](https://musicboxfun.com).

## At Home

I haven't read a lot of audiobooks lately but I still enjoy the occasional podcast. Evenings I do [daily demos](/2019/07/16/daily-demos-a-ritual-for-raising-kids-that-create/) with my kids. Saturdays I do a lot of reluctant home maintenance. Sundays I spend all day with my family.

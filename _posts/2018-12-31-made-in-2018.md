Things I made in 2018:

- The [Game of Life Youth Activity]({{site.url}}/2018/09/30/youth-group-activity-the-game-of-life/)
- The [Aspirational Hip-hop playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5oJkwTsohXLCG226Uul4mA)
- [CustomFormats.com](https://customformats.com/)
- The [Mastering VLOOKUP course](https://web.archive.org/web/20190317130901/https://gridmaster.io/#courses) (with a big thanks to Andrew Childress for his help)
- [24 blog posts]({{site.url}}/archives/#y2018)
- 38 [spreadsheet tips](https://us11.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=c6aa5d99b8059f1aba3005443&id=cf722f27b0) (again, thanks to Andrew Childress for helping put these together)
- [Commit Colors](https://github.com/sparkbox/commit-colors)

(some of these things are pretty trivial but you already know [I don't care much about that]({{site.url}}/2014/10/24/dumb-little-things/))

I also want to reflect a bit on my goals for the past year, which I had described in a Facebook post:

> In 2018, I'm aiming for substance. Reading more books and fewer online articles. More deep conversations and less small-talk. Working on a few big projects instead of many small ones. Ignoring the news cycle. Doing more writing.

I read 32 books in 2018, a huge improvement over the two I read in 2017. I mostly owe this success to getting a system in place for checking out audiobooks from the library using [Overdrive](https://www.overdrive.com/) (and eventually [Libby](https://meet.libbyapp.com/)). I did a lot of listening while doing chores and biking to work.

I wrote 26 blog posts in 2018, a small improvement over the 21 I wrote last year.

I also did a lot better at ignoring the news cycle. I unsubscribed from all news-related podcasts and if you've been tweeting or retweeting about current events, I probably unfollowed you. My only exception was developing a mild obsession with tracking the space industry. I started watching rocket launches and [the SpaceXNow app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bradleyjh.spacexnow&hl=en_US) tells me when they are about to happen.

I'd say 2018 was a step in the right direction for me. Here's to keeping it going in 2019.
